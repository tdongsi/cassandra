Performance Logging
=========

Record JMX values from a running Cassandra process, using JMXTerm (http://wiki.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm/), and do the following:

* Put the records into a Cassandra table.
* Plot the results.

Based on a Cassandra question on Glassdoor.

Currently, the first version works on Windows (DataStax Community installer).
